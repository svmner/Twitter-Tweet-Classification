# 🐦 Twitter Tweet Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying tweets into various categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning. It demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing and feature extraction to model training and evaluation.

## 🎯 Objective

- Clean and preprocess raw tweet data
- Perform feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings
- Train and evaluate multiple classification models
- Analyze feature importance and performance metrics
- Visualize tweet categories using dimensionality reduction techniques

## 🧾 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle Tweet Classification Datasets] (or custom dataset — if applicable)
- **Content:** Tweets labeled by category (e.g., News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Tech, etc.)
- **Text Fields:** Tweet body
- **Labels:** Multiclass classification labels

## 🛠️ NLP Pipeline

- Text cleaning (removal of links, mentions, hashtags, punctuation)
- Tokenization and lowercasing
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization
- TF-IDF vectorization

## 📈 Visualizations

- Word clouds and frequency distributions

- Confusion matrix and ROC curves

- t-SNE / PCA plots for high-dimensional feature visualization
